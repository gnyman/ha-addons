# My repository

This is a small repository where I will share my home-assistant addons.

For now there are just two versions of the same addon.

## havnc 

The normal version of havnc, it's the one I recommend and that I would personally use.

## havnc-dragons

Here be dragons, this is the latest and possibly (likely?) broken version of havnc, this is for masochists and people who run arch
